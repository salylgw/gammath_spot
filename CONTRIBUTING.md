**Purpose**

It is December 2023 and all the features necessary for SPOT proof-of-concept are now complete. I have added documentation to the point where it can be opened up for collaboration. The intent to make SPOT (**S**tock **P**rice-**O**pining **T**ool) an open source project is to make it transparent, to invite scrutiny of the source code, and to collaborate for making it one of the best and comprehensive stock analysis toolset that can benefit investors worldwide (**for free**). If you have expertise in one or more of Python, Finance/Investing, Deep learning, Cloud infrastructure, Flutter, Flask etc. and would like to participate in this project then please let me know (You can use "contact" form on [https://www.gammathworks.com](URL) or simply send me an email at salylgw@gmail.com).


**TBD features for collaboration**

  * Explore and include use of other data sources (regional and international) for the data scraper tool. I have seen that yfinance works for some stocks listed on exchanges outside the US but I haven't tested those much. [sample_watchlist.csv](https://github.com/salylgw/gammath_spot/blob/main/gammath_spot/sample_watchlist.csv) includes examples of stocks listed outside the US and needs to be expanded.
  * Stocks related domestic and international social networking sites need to be explored and used in the toolset
  * GPU and graphics related portability (including usage in docker container)
  * Replace python packages that are not supported with latest updates
  * Mobile app and Cloud backend (Currently under development using Flutter/Dart and Flask)
  * Any improvements (new features, improvements, bug fixes [if any], documentation, optimizations etc.).
