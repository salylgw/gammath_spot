**Purpose**

It is November 2022 and all the features necessary for SPOT proof-of-concept are now complete. I have added documentation to the point where it can be opened up for collaboration. The intent is to make SPOT (**S**tock **P**rice-**O**pining **T**ool) an open source project to make it transparent, to invite scrutiny of the source code, and to collaborate for making it one of the best and comprehensive stock analysis toolset that can benefit investors worldwide. If you have Python, Finance/Investing and/or Machine learning expertise and would like to participate in this project then please let me know (You can use "contact" form on [https://www.gammathworks.com](URL) or simply send me an email at salylgw@gmail.com).


**TBD features for collaboration**

  * Explore and include use of other data sources (regional and international) for the data scraper tool. We have seen that yfinance works for some stocks listed on exchanges outside the US but I haven't tested those much. [sample_watchlist.csv](https://github.com/salylgw/gammath_spot/blob/main/gammath_spot/sample_watchlist.csv) includes examples of stocks listed outside the US and needs to be expanded.
  * For stocks listed outside the US, related international/regional social networking sites need to be explored and used in the toolset
  * News sentiment analysis and scoring (using tools such as Natural Language Tool Kit, Spacy, Textblob etc.) needs to be implemented
  * Fundamental analysis enhancements to use as filtering criteria (preferably with a GUI)
  * Optimize the historian tool
  * Even though I've containerized SPOT, it needs to be made easy to use for users who are not familiar with Python environment
  * Any improvements (new features, bug fixes [if any], documentation, optimizations etc.)
