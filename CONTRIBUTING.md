**Purpose**

The intent of making python version of Gammathâ„¢ SPOT an open source project is to invite scrutiny of the algorithm and collaborate on new features to make it one of the best and comprehensive stock analysis toolset that can be used by investors (DIY or otherwise) worldwide. To that end, there are many features that I want to add to this toolset so if you have Python, Finance/Investing and/or Machine learning expertise and would like to work on any of the features then please let me know (You can use "contact" form on [https://www.gammathworks.com](URL) or simply send me an email at salylgw@gmail.com).

**TBD features for collaboration**

Data scraper and Analyzer/Scorer tools work great for me and save me incredible amount of time. However, there are some aspects that need few minutes of manual evaluation to make final buy/sell/hold decisions. To that end, I'm working on some features that we can collaborate on:

  * Data scraper tool updates for other data sources (including international/regional data sources. We have seen that yfinance works for some stocks listed on exchanges outside the US but haven't tested much outside the US. sample_watchlist.csv includes an example of a stock listed in Canada)
  * News sentiment analysis and scoring
  * Fundamental analysis enhancements to use as filtering criteria (preferably with a GUI)
  * Backtesting (using freely available backtesting.py Python framework)
  * Price predictor (You can use this as a [starting point](https://github.com/salylgw/gammath_spot/blob/main/gammath_spot/gammath_lgstic_signals.py) for the feature)



**HOWTO get involved**

  * To report bug(s), please use the [Issue Reporting template](https://github.com/salylgw/gammath_spot/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
  * To request new feature(s), please use the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/salylgw/gammath_spot/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).
