The intent of making python version of Gammathâ„¢ SPOT an open source project is to collaborate and make it one of the best, comprehensive stock analysis toolset that can be used by investors (DIY or otherwise) worldwide. To that end, there are many features that I want to add to this toolset so if you have Python, Finance and/or Machine learning expertise and would like to work on any of the features then please let me know (You can use "contact" form on https://www.gammathworks.com or simply send me an email at salylgw@gmail.com).

To report bug(s), please use the Issue Reporting template.
To request new feature(s), please use the Feature Request template. 

If you have a change that you would like to get reviewed by collaborators then please feel free to generate Pull requests. Until we have a contributing community in place, I'll have to review merge (if approved) the changes into the baseline myself.
